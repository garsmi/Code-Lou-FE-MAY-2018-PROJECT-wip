This is my project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development May 2018 course.

It is a portfolio site featuring some of my artwork and client work from over the years. 

The majority of the site is created via Bootstrap. I liked how the media queries and some pleasant effects were included. 

It is basically a navbar, jumbotron with a custom background image, bootstrap buttons which open boostrap modals. 

The first two modals are larger and serve as basic galleries of images. The third modal is a contact form.
